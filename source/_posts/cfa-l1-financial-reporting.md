6. Related issues in financial statements
    - B/S
      - A: current / non-current asset
      - L: current / non-current liability
      - A = L + E
      - E = contributed capital + beginning retained earnings + NI(current year) - dividend(current year) + OCI
    - I/S

    - by nature ?
    - by function ?

11. Non-recurring items
    - above the line infrequent items (pretax)
    - below the line infrequent items (net of tax): discontinued operation

      - change in accounting principles - retrospective
      - change in accounting estimates - prospective
      - prior error - retrospective

12. EPS

    - retained earnings = NI - dividend

15. Accounting treatment to marketable securities
    - held-to-maturity: amortized cost; UR not reported; R in I/S
    - trading: fair value; UR in I/S; R in I/S
    - available-for-sale: fair value; UR in OCI (B/S equity); R in I/S

16. Bad debt
    - beginning balance allowance + bad expense - write-offs of bad debt = ending balance allowance

17. Classification of activities in CFS
    - GAAP
      - CFO: interest paid/received; dividend received; tax paid

    - only focus on short-term items in CFO

19. Calculation of CFI and CFF
    - G/L = proceeds received - disposal NBV
    - BV<sub>end</sub> = BV<sub>begin</sub> + purchase - disposal NBV - depreciation
