1. Different types of investors & Investment products
    - required investment: ETF < mutual fund < separate managed account
    - traditional asset manager: equities + fixed-income / alternative asset manager: PE + hedge fund + real estate + commodities

2. Portfolio management process
    - Planning step: write IPS describing objectives and constraints; benchmark; reviewed and updated regularly
    - Execution step: asset allocation analysis -> security analysis -> portfolio construction
    - Feedback step: monitor and rebalance portfolio; measure portfolio performance

3. Expected return and Expected standard deviation
    - time-weighted return = ?
    - money-weighted return = ?
    - a portfolio of two risky assets
        - covariance = ?
        - variance = ?
        - correlation = ?

4. Markowitz's Theory
    - minimum variance frontier
    - global minimum variance portfolio
    - efficient frontier: efficient portfolio on it
    - risk-aversion: utility function A > 0; accept riskier investment if they are compensated in the form of greater expected return
    - indifference curve

5. Capital market theory
    - capital allocation line (CAL)
    - capital market line (CML): market portfolio; lending / borrowing portfolio
    - equation of CML ?

6. Security Market Line (SML)
    - beta = ?
    - equation of SML ?
    - graphical representation of CAPM: undervalued / overvalued

7. Performance Measures
    - Sharpe ratio = ?
    - Treynor measure = ?
    - M-squared alpha = ?
    - Jensen's alpha = ?
    - can determine performance from absolute value: M-squared alpha / Jensen's alpha
    - determine performance from relative ranking: Sharpe ratio / Treynor measure
    - fully diversified portfolio (use beta): Treynor measure / Jensen's alpha
    - non-diversified portfolio (use standard deviation): Sharpe ratio / M-squared alpha

8. Portfolio planning and construction
    - components of IPS
        - introduction
        - statement of purpose
        - statement of duties and responsibilities
        - procedures
        - investment objectives
        - investment constraints
        - investment guidelines
        - evaluation and review
        - appendices: strategic asset allocation / rebalancing policy

9. Investment objectives and constraints
    - risk measurement: absolute / relative / downside risk
    - return objectives: absolute / relative
    - investment constraints: liquidity / time horizon / tax / legal and regulatory / unique needs
    - ESG constraints: negative or positive screening / thematic investing / engagement investing

10. Risk management
    - risk management: bearing a tolerable level of risk
    - risk governance = board + management
    - financial risks: market risk / credit risk / liquidity risk
    - non-financial risks: other risks
    - measures of risk
        - value at risk (VaR): time + probability + min risk
        - Conditional VaR: weighted average of VaR
    - risk shifting vs risk transfer

11. Fundamentals of technical analysis
    - advantage of technical analysis
        - price and volume data is easy to access
        - objective analysis
        - can be applied to assets without future cash flows (e.g. commodities)
    - disadvantage
        - technical analysis is limited when manipulation in markets; illiquid markets

12. Charts
    - line charts: close prices
    - bar charts: open / close / high / low prices
    - candlestick charts: bar charts with color; green empty box / red filled box
    - point and figure charts: change a column when reversal price change exceeds reversal point

13. Common chart patterns
    - reversal pattern: head and shoulders pattern / triple tops and bottoms
    - continuation pattern: triangle / rectangle / flags and pennants

14. Indicators
    - price based
        - moving average lines
        - Bollinger bands
        - golden cross / dead cross
    - momentum oscillators
        - rate of change (ROC)
        - relative strength index
        - stochastic oscillator (KD)
        - moving average convergence/divergence (MACD)
    - sentiment
        - put/call ratio
        - volatility index (VIX)
        - margin debt
        - short interest ratio
    - flow of funds
        - arms index / short-term trading index
        - margin debt
        - mutual fund cash position
        - new equity issuance

15. Fintech in investment management
    - big data
    - advanced analytical tools: AI / ML
    - distribute ledger technology (DLT)
        - consensus mechanism
        - cryptography
        - blockchain
        - tokenization: represent ownership rights to physical assets
