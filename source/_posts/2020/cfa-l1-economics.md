1. Demand & Supply

    - Veblen (conspicuous) goods

5. Profits

6. Product

      - TR is maximized when ?
      - relationship between TR, P and elasticity?
    - perfect competition
      - MR = AR = D = P

8. Cost
    - short-run: labor and materials are variable

    - total cost = total fixed cost + total variable cost
    - marginal cost / average cost / average fixed cost / average variable cost

9. Profit maximization, breakeven point and shutdown point

      - difficulty to enter / leave
      - pricing power
      - example

12. Perfect competition
    - short-run: MR = MC; price-taker; MR = AR = P = D; perfectly elastic
    - long-run: MR = MC = ATC = P

13. Monopolistic competition
    - products are close substitutes; high elasticity
    - downward-sloping demand curve
    - innovation; branding; advertising
    - economic profit > 0 in short-run; = 0 in long-run

14. Oligopoly market
    - kinked demand curve model
    - Nash equilibrium
  
15. Monopoly
    - short-run & long-run: MR = MC = P×(1-1/e)
    - price discrimination
      - first-degree?
      - second-degree?
      - third-degree?
    - government regulation: force D = ATC

16. Market concentration
    - n-firm concentration ratio = ?
    - HHI index = ?

17. Basic concepts of GDP
    - GDP measures ?
    - GNP measures ?
    - GDP deflator = ?
    - expenditure approach GDP = ?
    - income approach GDP = ?

18. Saving and investment
    - expenditure GDP = income GDP

19. IS & LM curve and AD & AS curve
    - diagram of below all curves
    - investment-savings curve
      - equilibrium in goods market: S = I + (G-T) + (X-M)
      - move along: r
      - shift: fiscal policy; Y
    - liquidity preference-money supply curve
      - equilibrium in capital market: M<sub>supply</sub> / P = L<sub>1</sub> + L<sub>2</sub>
      - move along: r
      - shift: monetary policy
    - aggregate demand curve
      - move along: P
      - shift: fiscal & monetary policy; Y
    - aggregate supply curve
      - VSRAS
      - SRAS: upward sloping because inflexibility of wages and other input costs in short run
      - LRAS: price level has no impact on aggregate supply

20. Production function
    - Y/L = A × f(K/L)
    - growth in potential GDP = growth in tech + growth in labor + growth in capital
    - potential growth rate = long-term labor force growth rate + long-term labor productivity growth rate
